                <p>
                    Many community events struggle with limited visibility and reach, while potential attendees face difficulties discovering relevant local activities. Current solutions are fragmented across social media platforms, specialized websites, or physical bulletin boards, creating barriers to effective event discovery and management. Additionally, finding and booking suitable venues for events often involves a cumbersome process of researching, contacting, and negotiating with venue owners separately from the event planning process. UpNext addresses these challenges by providing a dedicated platform that integrates event creation, discovery, and venue booking in one cohesive ecosystem.
